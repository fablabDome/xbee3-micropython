## xbee3-micropython communication examples
The examples found here are for establishing basic communication between 2 xbee devices (coordinator and end-point).<br />
Work to be done: The sensor example using VL53L0X is successful for sending integers for PWM control at the End Device. However it is quickly thrown together, not optimal. Byte conversions may be necessary. Sending multiple bytes is also work to be done
